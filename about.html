            How to pronounce pseudo: Puh-sway-doh
            <h1>"Technical" Details</h1>
            I don't know why I didn't just use a library such as <a class="link" href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a>, but I guess I wanted a challenge and to impress the class. (I also wasn't looking for something like that ðŸ˜¬)
            <br><br> 
            So, in order to do my own highlighting, I created a custom HTML tag named "java", inside an div with codeeditor as the class. Then, I linked a script so we look for every element with the codeeditor class. We go through each line of code, word by word (separated by spaces) and apply the appropriate color to that word through CSS classes by placing it inside of a span tag.
            <br><br>
            Doing String highlighting was the worst to implement in my opinion. I ended up doing syntax highlighting and running RegExps on the almost finished HTML code, and did this with other things like commas, semicolons, comments, and making method names yellow. Syntax highlighting is obviously made on demand, if you ask. (View the HTML file source on GitHub, and open DevTools when opening the main webpage if you don't believe me)
            <br><br>
            You can easily break the highlighting by putting numbers in a class' or method's name. I had a few midterms coming up and just did whatever worked. 
            <br><br>
            The "Runnable Demos" were easy to implement. You add a script tag under the codeeditor and write the JavaScript interpretation of the Java code. eval() is used to execute that code, and I redirected all calls to console.log to pipe to an element temporarily. Writing my own Java compiler would've been out of the scope in terms of time.

            In terms of design, I drew heavy inspiration from my favorite IDE: <a class="link" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Intellij Idea CE</a>. The <a class="link" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">font used on this webpage</a> is also made by them.
