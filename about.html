            How to pronounce pseudo: Puh-sway-doh
            <h1>"Technical" Details / Commentary</h1>
            I don't know why I didn't just use a library such as <a class="link" href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a>, but I guess I wanted a challenge and to impress the class. (I also wasn't looking for something like that ðŸ˜¬)
            <br><br> 
            So, in order to do my own highlighting, I created a custom HTML tag named "java", inside an div with codeeditor as the class. Then, I linked a script so we look for every element with the codeeditor class. We go through each line of code, and apply string formatting first via  on innerHTML so we don't have to account for tags with attributes applied to them. Then, we can apply other formattings using regexes and replaceAll with context-sensitive things like making method names (not calls) yellow, keywords like int but not ...println() red & bold, annotations lime, and numbers blue. Semicolons and commas are made red, field accessors like out in sys.out.println() are made purple and italic (though the util in import java.util.List is also made purple). Finally, comments are made dark green. 
            <br><br>
            To process tooltips, in the Java HTML tag, I denote comments using the pipe (|) character. Multiple lines of comments are one giant comment for the line of code below it. The tooltip is added to the line element last because the regexes applied will most certainly interfere with it.
            <br><br>
            Learning that Safari and Mobile devices existed caused a huge change in the code since Safari doesn't handle lookarounds the same way that Chrome does, thus breaking the formatting and requiring workarounds...that still use regexes...
            <br><br>
            I only tested this on my custom build of macOS Chromium, macOS Safari 16~, and Simulator iOS' Safari. If you're using Edge or Opera or Firefox, you might be SoL or completely fine since I think they're all built upon Chromium. So, if you're using Arc, (which WTF is that?) then it will also work.
            <br><br>
            Definitely not efficient, but it works! 
            <br><br>
            You can easily break the highlighting by putting numbers in a class' or method's name. I had a few midterms coming up and just did whatever worked. 
            <br><br>
            The "Runnable Demos" were easy to implement. You add a script tag under the codeeditor and write the JavaScript interpretation of the Java code. eval() is used to execute that code, and I redirected all calls to console.log to pipe to an element temporarily. Writing my own Java compiler would've been out of the scope in terms of time.

            In terms of design, I drew heavy inspiration from my favorite IDE: <a class="link" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">Intellij Idea CE</a>. The <a class="link" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">font used on this webpage</a> is also made by them.
